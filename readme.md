Project Continuity
==================

Project Continuity is the subject of a series of Cambridge Developer's User 
Group hack days.  The objective is to build a simple note-taking application.
Notes can be synchronised to a server in the cloud, and accessed from client
applications running on a range of devices: mobile, PC, Mac, etc.
